# Hangman

simple terminal hangman game I created to practice python3 as part of jetbrains python tutorials.
usual rules of the game apply - project isn't perfect but useful to me as I continue to learn

launch from the terminal on a mac using "python3 hangman.py" command once in the designated folder.
